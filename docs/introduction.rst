Overview
--------

This project contains directions on how to contruct and operate a head-fixed
forelimb reaching task for mice. This design uses visual cues as reach targets,
though the design could be adapted easily to be cued via other sensory
modalities.

This Python library is used by a Raspberry Pi to control the hardware of the
behavioural task, and is then used to manipulate the data collected during
training.

Installation
------------
