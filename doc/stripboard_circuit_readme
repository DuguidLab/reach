This is an early prototype for the reach task circuit using stripboard.

It uses the BOARD pin layout in the code and pin numbers.

In this setup, the 2x4 strip sockets cover pins 17-24.

The pins in the python code are therefore:

p.paw_l = 19
p.paw_r = 21
p.start_button = 18

spouts[0].cue = 22
spouts[0].touch = 23
spouts[0].water = 24

Pin 17 is 3.3V
Pin 20 is ground
