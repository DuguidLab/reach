Training Box Construction
=========================

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This page describes how to construct a single training box, which looks like
this:

The base holds a Raspberry Pi which runs the reach code and operates the
training box hardware.


Parts list
----------

For best touch sensor performance, the mice should be electrically contiguous
with a much larger mass of conductive material. The capacittive touch sensors
work well with the human finger but may become more erratic when a mouse is
interacting them. I found this is largely improved by building the training
boxes on a metal table and line conductive tape from where the mice sit to the
table.

Steps
-----

#. Download this git repository onto the Raspberry Pi.
#. Add these lines to /boot/config.txt to disable LEDs:

 .. code-block::

    dtparam=eth_led0=14
    dtparam=eth_led1=14
    dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=none
    dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=off
    dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
    dtparam=act_led_activelow=off

3. Fix the base to the table with cable clips.
#. Fix the syringes to be higher than the base and attach around 1 metre of
