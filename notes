I tested the new touch sensors and it works even with the solenoid dispensing water which means that there is now closed loop turning off of the target light upon touch on most trials. I am playing around with foil tape on the target to maximise the chance of it going off while still allowing a bright target facing the mouse. On many trials I need to touch the circuit myself in order to turn off the light. In any case it clearly is not an inherent problem with the solenoid setup which is great news. Once this is at 99% turning off automatically the whole rig is fully functioning! This mice is getting the vast majority of trials successfully. At 60th trial he has only missed 2! I slowly moved the spout away from him throughout training to a max distance of 3mm
